  description: "About:\r\nTry your hand at guessing the correct ability name based
    on picture of an ability from League of Legends.\r\n\r\nManual:\r\nhttps://wouter17.github.io/Abilities/Manual/HTML/Abilities.html\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nAt
    first the module may seem daunting with the amount of abilities. However, after
    a few playthroughs you'll start to get a feel for what kind of name fits with
    each ability and you may be able to solo this.\r\n\r\nSource Code:\r\nhttps://github.com/Wouter17/Ablities\r\n\r\nLegal
